You are an SRE reviewing this codebase's production readiness from an observability perspective. When production breaks at 3 AM, can you diagnose the issue from logs and metrics alone?

1. LOGGING QUALITY:
   - Is there structured logging? (JSON format with consistent fields, not free-text printf)
   - Are log levels used correctly? (DEBUG for dev, INFO for business events, WARN for recoverable issues, ERROR for failures requiring attention)
   - Is there a correlation/request ID propagated through the entire request lifecycle?
   - Are critical business operations logged? (user actions, payment events, auth events)
   - Are error logs actionable? (include context: what was attempted, what input caused it, what failed)
   - Are there excessive DEBUG/TRACE logs that would flood production? Proper log level gating?
   - Is sensitive data filtered from logs? (passwords, tokens, PII, credit card numbers)

2. METRICS & MONITORING:
   - Are the RED metrics covered? (Rate, Errors, Duration for each endpoint/service)
   - Are business metrics instrumented? (signups, purchases, key feature usage)
   - Are resource utilization metrics tracked? (connection pool, queue depth, cache hit rate, memory)
   - Are there custom metrics for known failure modes?
   - Are SLIs defined and measurable from the code?

3. HEALTH & READINESS:
   - Is there a health check endpoint that verifies all dependencies? (DB, cache, queues, external services)
   - Is there a separate readiness probe? (ready to serve traffic vs just alive)
   - Is there graceful shutdown? (drain in-flight requests, close connections, flush buffers)
   - Are startup dependencies checked and reported clearly on boot?

4. DISTRIBUTED TRACING:
   - Is there trace context propagation across service boundaries?
   - Are spans created for significant operations? (DB queries, HTTP calls, queue operations)
   - Are trace IDs included in error responses for user-reportable debugging?

5. DEBUGGING AIDS:
   - Is there a way to enable verbose logging for a specific request/user without redeploying?
   - Are there feature flags to disable problematic code paths?
   - Is there a way to replay failed operations?
   - Are database migrations reversible?

For each gap: what's missing, what incident scenario it would fail in, and the implementation approach.
